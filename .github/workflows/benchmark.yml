# This workflow builds the NightHawk agent, run the tests, then publish a new release.
# You'll need to bump the version by modifying `ext.versions.agent` property in the build.gradle file
# then manually run this workflow to cut off a new release. The release name will be in the form of
# "v+versionNumber". For example, if `ext.versions.agent` = 0.5.1, the release name will be "v0.5.1".
