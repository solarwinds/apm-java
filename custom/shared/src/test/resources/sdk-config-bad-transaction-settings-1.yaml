# sdk-config.yaml is a typical starting point for configuring the SDK, including exporting to
# localhost via OTLP.

# NOTE: With the exception of env var substitution syntax (i.e. ${MY_ENV}), SDKs ignore
# environment variables when interpreting config files. This including ignoring all env
# vars defined in https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/.

# The file format version.
file_format: "0.3"

# Configure if the SDK is disabled or not. This is not required to be provided to ensure the SDK isn't disabled, the default value when this is not provided is for the SDK to be enabled.
disabled: false

# Configure resource for all signals.

  # Configure resource attributes. Entries have higher priority than entries from .resource.attributes_list.
  # Entries must contain .name nand .value, and may optionally include .type, which defaults ot "string" if not set. The value must match the type. Values for .type include: string, bool, int, double, string_array, bool_array, int_array, double_array.
