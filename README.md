# Solarwinds Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java

The Solarwinds Distribution of [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation for
Java](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation)
provides a Java agent that automatically instruments your Java application to capture and report
distributed traces and other telemetries to [Solarwinds Observability APM](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/content/intro/services.htm).
---

## Requirements

The agent works with Java runtimes version 8 and higher. For the full list of system and runtime requirements, see [Component supported by the Java Library](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/content/configure/services/java/support-matrix.htm) in the official documentation.
